## How to Edit Paper

To edit the paper you will need a LaTeX editor.
I recommend Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com

Once on overleaf, select "New Project"
Create a blank project. If there are any files there just delete them.
Finally, upload BOTH files from the paper folder above. Compile the LaTeX to make sure everything works.
Now feel free to edit.

When you are done, PLEASE push to GitHub. Otherwise we will have very serious versioning issues.
