The Noble Mahāsūtra Entering the City of Vaiśālī

                    
Thus did I hear at one time:
The Blessed One was residing in Nāḍikā, at the Impenetrable Dwelling Place.
The Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda,
“Ānanda, let us proceed to the city of Vaiśālī.”
“Let us do so, O Honored One,” replied the venerable Ānanda, assenting to what the Blessed One had said.
Thereupon the Blessed One, traveling through the country of Vṛji, arrived in Vaiśālī.
In Vaiśālī, he stayed in Āmrapālī’s grove.

                    
“Ānanda, go to the city of Vaiśālī, place your foot on the threshold of the city gate, and
utter these mantras and these verses:
“ ‘ Visarata visarata visarata visarata
