“How are we to live?
How are we to practice?
How are we to train?
How are we to ripen others?” 
went before them and sat down on a seat by the pavilion in front of them.
Sitting there, the Blessed One said to the many bodhisattvas,
“Noble sons, excellent, excellent.
Your intention is noble,
your questions are beautiful,
your eloquence is virtuous, and
your concerns are proper.
Therefore, noble sons, listen carefully and keep in mind what is said.
