The Noble Dhāraṇī of Parṇaśavarī

                    

                    
Homage to the thus-gone, worthy, perfect buddha, the blessed Amitābha.
Homage to the bodhisattva great being, the deeply compassionate and noble Avalokiteśvara.
Homage to the bodhisattva great being Mahāsthāmaprāpta.

                    

                    

                    
May these words of mantra empowered by the wise guard me and all beings.
May they protect us, keep us secure, defend us, and bring us peace and good fortune.
May they protect us from punishment and weapons.
May they neutralize all poisons.
May they protect from the dangers of fire and the dangers of water.
May they cut down kākhordas.
May they establish the protective boundary and bind the earth.

                    
Grant peace!
Pacify every illness!
Bring an end to all kinds of untimely death!
Pacify all evil influences from the planets and stars!
Pacify all venom!
O Blessed Parṇaśavarī!
