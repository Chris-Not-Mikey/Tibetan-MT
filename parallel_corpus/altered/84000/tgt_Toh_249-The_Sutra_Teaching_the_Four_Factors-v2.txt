The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra Entitled Teaching the Four Factors

                    

                    
The Blessed One was dwelling in the Sudharmā assembly hall in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, together with a great gathering of five hundred monks,

                    
“O Maitreya, bodhisattva mahāsattva, if you possess four factors, the misdeeds you have committed and accumulated will be overcome.

                    
The action of repentance, antidotal action, the power of restraint, and the power of support.

                    

                    

                    

                    
By relying on such powerful forces, you will be immune to misdeeds.

                    
The bodhisattva mahāsattva should continually read this sūtra,
recite it aloud,
and reflect [and meditate] on it,
[and reflect] and meditate on it,
doing so many times.
Through this, the effects of negative conduct will not come about.”

                    
the whole assembly, including the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, the monks, the bodhisattvas, and the ranks of the gods, such as Śakra, were overjoyed and full of praise for what the Blessed One had taught.
