The Noble Great Vehicle Sūtra Teaching the Practice of a Bodhisattva

                    

                    
The Blessed One was dwelling at the Kūṭāgāraśālā in the forest outside of Vaiśālī together with a great assembly of one thousand monks.
All of them were worthy ones whose defilements were exhausted.
They were without afflictions and in control.
Their minds were perfectly free, and their insight was perfectly liberated.

Their behavior was peaceful, disciplined, free, and natural.
The only exception was Venerable Ānanda,
but the Blessed One had instructed him in the practice as well, and
he had been prophesied to become a worthy one in this life.

                    
All of them had obtained retention.
All of them possessed the patience of equanimity.
All of them had reached the stage where one practices exactly what has been proclaimed.
They were wise, honest, and faithful.
They were extremely confident and exceedingly graceful.
They always smiled and never frowned angrily.
They were steadfast and successful.
They had realized the nature of phenomena
and never tired of teaching the Dharma.
They had encountered the wisdom of a buddha and were bringing it to full maturity.
They possessed unerring patience regarding allusive speech.
They had attained the stage of being unmistaken regarding all objects.
They knew the right time, season, occasion, and moment.
They were free from agitation and arrogance.
Their behavior was natural and perfect.
They were skilled in the meditative absorption on emptiness.
They had relinquished arising and disintegration.
They possessed the meditative absorption on wishlessness.
They had practiced bodhisattva conduct in cyclic existence for a long time.
They possessed the meditative absorption on signlessness.
They correctly understood the characteristics of all the content of mental constructs. 
They were skilled in maturing beings.
They were free from ideation.
They were skilled in the presentation of the Hearer Vehicle.
They engaged in properly distinguishing the teachings of the Dharma.
They taught the Solitary Buddha Vehicle.
They praised tranquility.
They inspired beings to become bodhisattvas.
They behaved appropriately, teaching the Dharma without hatred or animosity.

                    
Also dwelling with them were many thousands of other bodhisattvas.

                    
took up his alms bowl, and went to collect alms in the city of Vaiśālī accompanied and attended by two thousand monks.
As soon as the Blessed One placed his foot at the threshold of the city gates, the following wondrous miracles occurred, miracles that occur whenever the blessed buddhas enter a city:
blind people gained sight,
deaf people gained hearing,
and the insane regained their senses.
A rain of divine flowers fell, a bright light shone,
and the roads became free of filth.
The enchanting musical instruments of the gods resounded even without being played.
All beings, from the Hell of Uninterrupted Torment up to the Highest Heaven, became completely happy.

                    
The three-year-old was sitting on his mother’s lap on the top floor of their house, and
when he witnessed these miraculous signs,
the boy Ratnadatta spoke the following verses to his mother:

                    
This light outshines the radiance Of millions of suns. Whose is it?

                    
And dries up the lower realms.
What is this magical light?
Quick, Mother, please tell me!

                    
And everywhere flocks of birds Fill the air with song.

                    
The flower parasols unfurled,
And both sides are adorned With happy men and women.

                    
Deaf people can hear sounds,
Those who were ugly are now handsome,
Those of poor complexion now have perfect skin, 

                    
The mute can speak clearly,
And beings who had no love in their hearts Are now filled with love.

                    
Who is this extraordinary being
Who moves throughout the worlds
With the power to perform such miracles?”

                    

                    
A stainless victor without harmful intent
Who is beyond thought and utterly pure.
He is powerful, exalted in precious virtues.

                    
This is our kinsman, the Thus-Gone One,
A wise man come to beg alms
Who does not adhere to worldly duty.

                    
The lord engages in conduct without being stained, Like a lotus born from the water.

                    
He benefits beings and is compassionate.
To dispel the suffering of beings.
Now this leader has come here

                    
And blame does not upset him.
He has abandoned anger and attachment
And moves freely, like the wind.

                    
Who has mastered profound wisdom
And is learned in the ultimate meaning—
The teacher of beings has come.

                    
That is free from grasping at existence or nonexistence.
He possesses the path of Dharma and is peaceful.
He has abandoned all types of dependence.

                    
Who has gathered the accumulation of merit,
The blissful one, the guide of the world
Whose form is boundless, has come today!

                    
And is soft, shiny, and curly.
It is black, not matted,
And perfectly adorns his head.

                    
Its hair is coiled, and it is perfectly placed.
It resembles the peak of Mt. Meru—
So beautiful is its shape. 

                    
That is smooth and turns to the right.
Its radiance is far brighter than a lattice
Of pure crystal lunar rays.

                    
Like blue lotus flowers.
He has perfect eyelashes like a cow.
He has a peaceful gaze without redness or agitation.

                    
And he always has a smile on his face.
His lips are red like a bimba fruit,
His beautiful face attracts all embodied beings.

                    
The strength of hundreds of merits.
The rows of his teeth have a beautiful shine,
And they are even and perfectly spaced.

                    
His tongue is very long and thin,
And with it he can completely cover
The surface of his own face.

                    
Likewise, his nose is prominent,
His complexion is like refined gold,
And he has a beautiful forehead.

                    
And the color of blue sapphire.
His peaceful eyes are beautiful
And extend toward his ears.

                    
His face is more beautiful than an autumn moon
And resembles a perfectly pure lotus.
It is radiant, pure, and clear.

                    
And his voice is kind, pleasing,
And soft; it satisfies beings
Like the call of a sparrow.

                    
A parrot, a myna, and a cuckoo,
Of thunder, a crane,

                    
However pleasant, does not match a sixteenth Of the voice of the Thus-Gone One.

                    
It is sweet and gentle,
Endearing, pleasing, and clear.
It is flawless and fearless.

                    
It satisfies and pacifies the mind.
It is uncorrupted, unmistaken, perfectly peaceful,
Pure, and also easy to comprehend. 

                    
Meaningful, and possesses all good qualities.
His poetic embellishments are perfect.
His speech inspires virtue.

                    
different interpretations
Have faith in what he says
And become exceedingly happy.
In the world systems of the ten directions,

                    
And the words of the protector
Are rendered meaningful to all those beings.

                    
He is broad chested,
And the seven parts

                    
His skin the color of gold.
He is as tall as the wish-fulfilling tree,
His girth like a banyan.

                    
His lotus hands bear the imprints of a wheel.
They are soft to the touch like cotton or flower petals,
And their fingers are long.

                    
His torso is broad and his navel is deep.
His belly is the shape of a bow, and his genitals are retracted in a sheath like an elephant.
He has calves like an antelope and with a white hue like the inside of a reed.

                    
The sage’s fingers are long and his nails are red.
The soles of the Blissful One’s feet are not arched,
And they are adorned with wheels, hooks, svastikas, and conches.

                    
They are soft and pleasing to the touch like cotton.
Their color is like a blooming red lotus,
And with them he traverses the worlds.

                    
This chief among beings has now arrived here,
And the lack of mental constructs with the fearless roar of a lion.”
And when he comes, he teaches the Dharma of nonduality

                    
“Mother, put me in the window so I can see the Thus-Gone One,”
so his mother sat him in the window.
The Blessed One knew what Ratnadatta was thinking, so he walked right down his street.
When the boy saw the Blessed One walking he thought,
“Whoever sees the Thus-Gone One, who possesses all good qualities, and
does not generate the mind of awakening is indeed unfortunate.”
The Blessed One proceeded right up to Ratnadatta’s door
and the boy thought,
“Since it is difficult to meet such an extraordinary being even in a trillion eons,
I should jump down from this house.”

                    
and [With that thought, Ratnadatta placed his toy, a golden lotus with a hundred thousand petals, in the palm of his hand and] jumped off the house.
However, due to the Buddha’s power, he remained floating in midair.
Ratnadatta then offered the golden lotus with a hundred thousand petals to the Blessed One.
As soon as Ratnadatta let go of the lotus, the Blessed One transformed it into a lotus parasol adorned with a net of jewels, and it hovered in the sky directly above the Blessed One’s head.
When that happened, the boy Ratnadatta recited the following verses:

                    
To eliminate all goals. I seek supreme awakening

                    
And nothing to accept or reject, I offer this flower.
That childish beings construct is pointless. 
So that I may eliminate all conceptual thought. I make this offering to the supreme human being

                    
To eliminate all existent things. I offer this lotus blossom

                    
May even the names hearer or solitary buddha Not arise there.”

                    

                    

                    

                    
Conditioned things are hollow and void.
How could such phenomena Have any substance?

                    
And grasp at the state of a worthy one,
But aren’t consciousness and
Simply empty?

                    
Those millions perceive only quiescence,
And there is not one of them who does not find joy in that.

                    
Can someone who thinks as you do
Even purify a gift?”

                    
“Child, tell me, has the Thus-Gone One not become a complete buddha who has manifested unsurpassed and perfect awakening? Furthermore, has he not taught the Dharma?”

                    
They should not impute concepts such as the thought that phenomena do not arise,
the thought that all phenomena are conditioned, or
the thought that all phenomena are unconditioned.
They should not impute concepts such as ‘all phenomena arise, do not arise, are existent, or are nonexistent,’ ‘grasping and letting go,’ ‘meeting and separating,’ ‘going, coming, remaining, transmigrating, phenomena associated with attachment, hatred, and delusion, and right and wrong.’
They should not impute the concept that ‘ignorance and the like
So you tell me, Maudgalyā­yana—do you think the thus-gone ones are complete buddhas who manifest unsurpassed and perfect awakening?”
Maudgalyā­yana replied, “That is not the case.”

                    
Maudgalyā­yana said, “That is not the case.”

                    
“I teach by means of the conventions of the world,” Maudgalyā­yana replied.

                    
“Maudgalyā­yana,” answered the boy, [the world is a fake, deceptive, and illusory appearance] "phenomena cannot be demonstrated. 

                    
They cannot be demonstrated, attained, actualized, abandoned, understood, or meditated upon.”

                    
“Maudgalyā­yana,” the boy asked, “do you apprehend a Thus-Gone One, someone who gives a gift, or an act of giving?”

                    
so the boy Ratnadatta continued, “Maudgalyā­yana, with this in mind, I have given up becoming a thus-gone one and
say those who form the resolve set on the vehicle of the hearers ‘are indeed unfortunate.’ ”

                    

                    
Yet your insight is vast as the ocean.
How long have you been Trained in these teachings?”

                    

                    
Training is not training.
Consists in being one who lacks training. The training of the wise ones

                    
Is based upon the perceptions of beings,
Any phenomena arising anywhere.
And to this I say one does not find

                    
So do you, Venerable One, Still follow the way of childish beings?

                    

                    
So you too should see these as merely empty.

                    
Is an illogical imputation.
If the phenomenon of awakening does not arise, How can one attain nirvāṇa?

                    
Yet there is no such thing as the liberation of beings.
Between nirvāṇa and saṃsāra. Understand this: there is no distinction 

                    
About the fact that phenomena are indistinct. The wise harbor no delusions

                    
A childish being who attains nirvāṇa
Is thoroughly attached to saṃsāra.
Such conceited thinking is Māra’s trap.

                    
They will proceed to their next birth
And start all over again in ignorance.

                    
The awakening of all the buddhas Is a conventional term but nothing in actuality.

                    
Those who see correctly in that way Fully understand the nature of reality.

                    
“Blessed One, how long has this boy Ratnadatta practiced this teaching?”

                    
“When the thus-gone one Dīpaṁkara gave his prophecy that I would attain acceptance of the nonarising of phenomena,
at that point he was foremost among those bodhisattvas who abided in emptiness according to Dīpaṁkara’s teachings.
At the moment when I first generated the mind set on unsurpassed and perfect awakening, three hundred thousand eons had passed since he attained acceptance.”

                    
“what cause and what conditions are responsible for the boy Ratnadatta not becoming a complete buddha who has manifested unsurpassed and perfect awakening?”

                    

                    
“Why have you not become a complete buddha who has manifested unsurpassed and perfect awakening?” 

                    

                    

                    
if he becomes the referent object of that grasping, then
the Dharma he teaches will not cause that person to become a complete manifest buddha, and it will not even bring about renunciation.”

                    

                    
“I do not perceive even a single phenomenon that is truly established, much less four.
What is there truly established in them?
‘Knowing the Dharma’ is apprehension.
‘Awakening’ is apprehension.
‘The Thus-Gone One’ is grasping.
‘Liberation’ is a mental construct.”

                    
that you have attained such a miraculous birth whereby you were born in the presence of the buddhas and will always go forth!”

                    

                    
They are the level of conceptual imputation and the domain of Māra.
Desire realm beings such as the gods and asuras who grasp at And harbor conceit about phenomena such as the body are destroyed in this domain.

                    
Some set out with the same intention
And insult the buddhas.
Though they attain it, there is nothing in it that the guides attain.

                    
They are confused by mental apprehension And they corrupt the teachings.

                    
But the teaching of the protector, the lion of the Śākya clan, Lacks mental constructs. 

                    
Thus, the view taught by the guide Has no inherent nature.

                    
That is why those who have insight Do not grasp at the thought, ‘I am free.’

                    
Such unwise people Reject emptiness as incorrect.

                    
Like a dream and an illusion. Then, when things cease, they call it nirvāṇa.

                    
And do away with the notion of discipline.
They take mental apprehention as a support
And do away with the notion of meditative absorption.

                    
And have a deluded notion of it as a seed.
The wise people of the world
Proclaim them thieves of the Dharma.

                    
The point of going forth?
So, will you please tell me

                    
They are like an echo.
The sphere of the noble ones.
The wise never conceptualize

                    
They never transform into other things.
Since phenomena are unchanging, What use is the concept of going forth?”

                    
“Child, what is ‘awakening’ a verbal designation for?”
“Mañjuśrī,” Ratnadatta replied, “awakening is devoid of verbal designations.”

                    
Ratnadatta replied, “Mañjuśrī, since reality is inconceivable, I consider it as such and then express it.”

                    
How should they be taught about it?” 

                    
‘Do not abandon desire.
Do not get rid of anger.
Do not clear away delusion.
Do not rise above the body.
Practice nonvirtue.
Do not vanquish views.
Do not remove
Grasp at the aggregates.
Make the elements into a single mass.
Engage the sense spheres.
Do not go beyond the level of childish beings.
Realize nonvirtue.
Abandon virtue.
Do not contemplate the Buddha.
Do not think about the Dharma.
Do not make offerings to the Saṅgha.
Do not take up the trainings.
Do not strive to pacify existence.
Do not cross over the river.’

                    
[“It is with such instructions that one should instruct and] teach beginner bodhisattvas.
Why is that?
Because only this state is the state of phenomena.
Childish beings declare that phenomena arise and
declare that phenomena cease.
The realm of phenomena is discerned through nonconceptuality.
If someone receives the instruction that understanding the nature of phenomena in this way is awakening, and
if they are not afraid, scared, or frightened by it, then
that person is a bodhisattva who will truly never regress.
That bodhisattva who has reached the stage free from regression should be considered a fortunate one.
Through these instructions, one should give rise to true joy again and again.”

                    
They all vomited warm blood and died, and
after they died they were reborn in the Great Wailing Hell.
At that point Mañjuśrī­kumāra­bhūta alerted the Blessed One saying,
“Blessed One, see how those monks have suffered such great harm by listening to this Dharma teaching!” 

                    
“If these monks had not heard this Dharma teaching,
they would not have secured higher births for millions of eons, let alone meeting and serving any buddhas.
Since they just listened to this Dharma teaching with doubt, they are right now dying and transmigrating from the Great Wailing Hell and being reborn among the gods in the Heaven of Joy.
For sixty-eight eons, they will serve billions of thus-gone ones.
In all these lives they will only take miraculous birth and become universal monarchs.
In a later eon they will become thus-gone ones, worthy ones, perfect complete buddhas known as Vimalaprabhāsa.”

                    
those gods, together with eighty thousand gods, traveled to where the Blessed One was.
When they arrived, they scattered divine flowers all over Vaiśālī.
They rejoiced in this Dharma teaching, saying,
“Blessed One, we rejoice!
Please cause the system of the awakening of the thus-gone ones to flourish!”
The moment that they rejoiced in this way, they became irreversible from unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
Eighty-four thousand beings of the great city of Vaiśālī also became irreversible from unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
Twelve thousand beings removed the dust from the Dharma eye that sees all phenomena, rendering it stainless and pure.”

                    
“Mañjuśrī, since someone who listens to this Dharma teaching with doubt generates far greater merit than a bodhisattva who practices the six perfections without skillful means for one hundred thousand eons , why mention someone who has no doubt when they hear it?
And why mention those who write it down, explain it, hold it, and teach it extensively to others?
Therefore, Mañjuśrī, those who want to attain the state of a worthy one should train in this teaching,
those who want to attain the state of a solitary buddha should train in this teaching, and
those who want to become a complete buddha who manifests unsurpassed and perfect awakening should train in this teaching.”

                    
“Mother, please give me some food, and I will offer it to the Blessed One.”
Ratnadatta’s mother filled a metal bowl with delicious food and gave it to the child.
Ratnadatta then addressed the Blessed One, saying,
“Blessed One, since it is true that all phenomena are inexhaustible, may the food in this metal bowl not diminish until the entire saṅgha of monks has been satisfied.”
Ratnadatta filled the Blessed One’s alms bowl first and then addressed the saṅgha of monks, saying,
“Venerable Ones, may these alms be accepted out of compassion for me by someone who can ensure that I obtain a great result.
May these alms be accepted by someone who does not purify the gift with the body, who does not purify it with the mind;
someone who will not generate merit or ripen karma when it is offered to them;
someone who has no physical, verbal, or mental karma;
someone who abides neither in the conditioned nor in the unconditioned;
someone who is not stained by the qualities of ordinary beings;
someone who does not rely upon the teachings of the hearers;
someone who is not skilled in the vehicle of the buddhas;
and someone who has no wish to be skilled in it!”

                    
so the child Ratnadatta continued, “Venerable Ones, I wish to make a gift, and you also wish to eat.
I do not expect anything in return from you venerable ones, so please eat!
If it is true that my buddha realm will have a display of qualities that is a billion times greater than the display of qualities present in the buddha realms of billions of bodhisattvas who are of the same stature as Mañjuśrī, and
if it is true that what I have spoken is the truth, then by these true statements may all your bowls be filled from this metal bowl, and
may this bowl never be emptied!”
All the alms bowls of the saṅgha of monks were then filled.
The child Ratnadatta fed the entire population of Vaiśālī with delicious food, and
even then the alms did not run out.

                    
“Ratnadatta, these five are a bodhisattva’s purification of a gift:
not apprehending a body, not apprehending a mind, having no attachment to the gift, not desiring any ripening, and no ripening for the recipients.
Moreover, Ratnadatta, a bodhisattva should always manifest the following four things:
the meditative concentration of emptiness, recollecting the Buddha, great compassion, and the ripening of one’s own karma.”

                    
“Mañjuśrī, in thirty eons, this child Ratnadatta will become a complete buddha who has manifested unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
He will appear in the world as a thus-gone one, a worthy one, a perfect buddha, learned and virtuous, a blissful one, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed charioteer who tames beings, a teacher of gods and humans, a blessed buddha called Amogha­bala­kīrti.
Those who gather in his retinue will be infinite in number, and
all of them will be bodhisattvas who do not regress.
They will be infinitely radiant and have immeasurable lifespans.”

                    
“Blessed One, what is the name of this Dharma teaching?
How should it be remembered?”

                    
“You should remember it as Teaching the Practice of a Bodhisattva, or
you can also remember it as A Being Born from Reality.”

                    
after the Blessed One had said this,
the bodhisattva Ratnadatta, the entire retinue, and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the Blessed One’s words.
This concludes the noble Great Vehicle sūtra “Teaching the Practice of a Bodhisattva.”
